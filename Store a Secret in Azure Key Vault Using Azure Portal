Steps to Store a Secret in Azure Key Vault Using Azure Portal
Navigate to Azure Key Vault

Log in to the Azure Portal.
Use the search bar to search for Key Vaults.
Select the Key Vault where you want to store the secret.
Go to the Secrets Section

In the Key Vault's Overview page, find the Secrets option in the left-hand menu under Settings.
Click on Secrets.
Add a New Secret

Click the + Generate/Import button at the top.
In the Create a secret form, fill in the following:
Name: Enter a unique name for the secret, e.g., ClientCredentials.
Value: Enter the value of the secret, e.g., user@example.com|superSecretPassword|12345.
Optional Settings

Set activation date: Specify a future date if the secret should not be available immediately.
Set expiration date: Specify when the secret should expire (recommended for security).
Content type: Optionally describe the secret, e.g., Client Credentials.
Save the Secret

Click the Create button to save the secret in the Key Vault.
Verify the Stored Secret
After creating the secret, you’ll see it listed in the Secrets section of the Key Vault.
Click on the secret name (e.g., ClientCredentials) to view its properties.
Under the Current Version, click to see details and confirm that the value is stored correctly.
Note: The value will only be displayed during creation or when specifically viewing it—after creation, you won’t see the value directly for security reasons.
